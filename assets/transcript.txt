[00:00] CRL Rep (Maya Patel): Hi Dr. Chen, thanks for taking the discovery call today. I know you are also looking at WuXi and Labcorp, so my goal is to get crisp on scope, timeline, and where CRL can be most helpful for NC-217. Sound good?

[00:15] Client (Dr. Li Chen, VP Translational Science, NovaCura Biotech): Yes, that works. We are moving quickly, so I want to make sure you can hit the window.

[00:24] Maya: Great. Let me start by confirming what you sent over email. NC-217 is a small-molecule oncology candidate in late lead optimization. You want two xenograft efficacy models, colorectal plus a PD-L1 high lung model, with pERK and Ki-67 biomarkers. First readouts in 6 to 8 weeks for an end-of-January go/no-go tied to IND in early Q2. Optional non-GLP rat DRF in parallel if feasible. Budget expectation 250k to 300k for efficacy. Is that all correct?

[00:55] Dr. Chen: Yes, that captures it.

[00:58] Maya: Perfect. Let us unpack the efficacy first. When you say first readouts in 6 to 8 weeks, is that from compound receipt, or from study start?

[01:08] Dr. Chen: From compound receipt. We need tumor curves early enough to decide by the end of January. If we slip, the IND plan slips.

[01:20] Maya: Understood. That is a clear urgency driver. You mentioned batch release Friday and shipment early next week. If we receive compound next week, we can usually start model prep immediately, and get animals on study about two weeks from receipt, subject to scheduling. That keeps you inside the 6 to 8 week readout window. Does mid-December study start work for your gate?

[01:47] Dr. Chen: Yes, but we need a firm start date. Our COO Jenna will want that before signing off.

[01:56] Maya: Noted. We will give you a Gantt-level timeline in the proposal. Now on models. For colorectal, you said you have used a specific xenograft before. Which line and implantation approach are you tied to?

[02:11] Dr. Chen: We used the HCT116 subcutaneous model, standard implantation. We can share the protocol and prior report.

[02:21] Maya: Great. We have that in-house, so matching your historical protocol should be straightforward. For the PD-L1 high lung model, which one are you leaning toward?

[02:34] Dr. Chen: We are leaning toward a PD-L1 high A549 variant. We have less internal experience there, and we have seen variability in implantation with a prior CRO.

[02:49] Maya: Thanks, that is important. We can talk through our implantation QC. We track take-rate and tumor size distribution before randomization, and we can share historical ranges. If take-rate is a concern, we will build a contingency for extra animals. Would that address your consistency risk?

[03:12] Dr. Chen: Yes, assuming you can show data.

[03:15] Maya: We will include that. Study design wise, you said 3 arms per model, 8 to 10 animals per arm. Vehicle, low, high. Any thoughts yet on dose levels?

[03:28] Dr. Chen: We are still finalizing. We have a workable oral formulation at 10 mg/mL. Likely two doses bracketed around our in vitro IC50 exposure, but we will confirm after stability is finalized.

[03:46] Maya: Great. We will draft the plan with placeholders and lock doses once we see your prior PK and stability notes. On endpoints: tumor growth inhibition is primary. Biomarkers pERK and Ki-67, with IHC and image analysis on your behalf. Anything else?

[04:06] Dr. Chen: We would like tissue banking for future RNA-seq if it is easy to add. Not mandatory.

[04:13] Maya: Easy add-on. We will price it as an option line item. Do you want interim updates?

[04:20] Dr. Chen: Weekly interim curves would be ideal.

[04:24] Maya: Done. Now, on early safety. You mentioned a short non-GLP rat DRF in parallel, mostly to satisfy the board and derisk before GLP tox. Can you say more about what they want to see?

[04:41] Dr. Chen: A 7-day tolerability readout with basic clinical observations and exposure. Not GLP. If efficacy is weak we will stop, so we do not want to over-invest yet.

[04:56] Maya: Makes sense. We can run a non-GLP 7-day DRF in rat through our DSA group, starting parallel to efficacy if scheduling allows. We will also align endpoints so you can roll into GLP tox later without rework. Is formal GLP tox still a March decision depending on January efficacy?

[05:18] Dr. Chen: Yes, likely March if January data is positive.

[05:23] Maya: Great. That gives a clean roadmap. Let me ask about decision process. You said in email it is you and COO Jenna making the call, with procurement after selection. Is Jenna going to want a joint review?

[05:39] Dr. Chen: Yes. She will review pricing and timeline with me. She will want to know why CRL over WuXi if we go single partner.

[05:52] Maya: Understood. We will make that comparison easy. Speaking of competitors, you said WuXi and Labcorp are in the mix. Any specific concerns with them, or is it mostly cost and speed?

[06:07] Dr. Chen: WuXi is fast and cost-competitive, but we had variability in tumor implantation quality last time. Labcorp feels strong on tox, less on these specific efficacy models.

[06:25] Maya: Helpful. We will emphasize implantation QC and model reproducibility, and the value of a single partner across RMS efficacy and DSA DRF, so you do not have to coordinate two CROs. On pricing: you flagged 250k to 300k as a target for the two efficacy models including biomarkers. If we are above that, is there any flexibility?

[06:54] Dr. Chen: Limited. If it is meaningfully higher, we will need justification, or we will split vendors.

[07:02] Maya: Clear. We will aim to be in range and show what is included. I will also structure two scenarios: efficacy only, and efficacy plus parallel DRF, so you can decide based on budget.

[07:18] Dr. Chen: That would help.

[07:20] Maya: Let me check for any gaps we should close today. I need your historical colorectal protocol and prior report, plus any preliminary PK rationale for dose selection. You said you can send those by tomorrow?

[07:36] Dr. Chen: Yes, my scientist will send protocol and report tomorrow. PK summary can go with it. Stability data may follow early next week.

[07:50] Maya: Perfect. With that, here are next steps:

1. You send protocol, prior report, and PK summary tomorrow, stability notes early next week.
2. We send a proposal with timeline and pricing by Thursday, covering both scenarios (efficacy only vs efficacy + DRF).
3. If the proposal looks good, we schedule a 30-minute technical scoping call early next week with our discovery biology lead and DSA tox lead to lock models and endpoints.
   Does that align with your internal timing?

[08:28] Dr. Chen: Yes. If I have your proposal by Thursday, I can review with Jenna on Friday morning. Then we can decide next week.

[08:40] Maya: Great. I will tentatively hold Tuesday at 11:00 AM ET for the technical scoping, pending your review. Anything else you want us to consider?

[08:53] Dr. Chen: Just make sure the lung model consistency risk is addressed, and that the timeline is firm.

[09:01] Maya: Absolutely. We will include implantation QC data and a contingency plan, and we will commit to a start date based on compound arrival. Thanks, Dr. Chen. I will send a short recap email today and the proposal Thursday.

[09:18] Dr. Chen: Thanks, Maya. Talk soon.

[09:21] Maya: Talk soon.
