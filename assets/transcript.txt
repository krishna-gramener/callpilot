[00:00] Maya: Hi Dr. Chen, thanks for taking the discovery call today. I know you have Wuxi and Labcorp in the mix, so my goal is to make it really easy to see where CRL fits – in terms of models, biomarkers, timeline, and where CRL can be most helpful for NC-217. Sound good?

[00:15] Dr. Chen: Yes, that works. We are moving quickly, so I want to make sure you can hit the window.

[00:24] Maya: Great. Let me start by confirming what you sent over so we are aligned. This is a small-molecule oncology program, NC-217, late lead optimization. You are planning two xenograft efficacy models – a colorectal model, HCT116 subcutaneous, and a PD-L1 high lung model – plus pERK and Ki-67 as pharmacodynamic biomarkers with IHC and image analysis. There is also an optional non-GLP rat DRF you may want to run in parallel to get exposure and tolerability ahead of GLP. You are targeting first readouts in 6 to 8 weeks to make an end-of-January go/no-go for your IND in early Q2. You have other CROs in the mix, specifically Wuxi and Labcorp, but you have some concerns on consistency and timeline. And budget expectation is 250k to 300k for efficacy. Is that all correct?

[00:55] Dr. Chen: Yes, that captures it.

[00:58] Maya: Perfect. Let us unpack the efficacy first. When you say first readouts in 6 to 8 weeks, is that from compound receipt, or from study start?

[01:08] Dr. Chen: From compound receipt. We need tumor curves early enough to decide by the end of January. If we slip, the IND plan slips.

[01:20] Maya: Understood. That is a clear urgency driver. You mentioned the batch is releasing this Friday, and you can ship early next week. On our side, we can typically get animals on study within about two weeks of compound receipt, assuming we lock protocol details quickly. That would put first tumor readouts roughly in your 6 to 8 week window. Does mid-December study start work for your gate?

[01:47] Dr. Chen: Yes, but we need a firm start date. Our COO Jenna will want that before signing off.

[01:56] Maya: Noted. We will give you a Gantt-level timeline in the proposal with a specific first-dose date and readout window, so you can take that to Jenna. Let me go one level deeper on the models. You said you have used the HCT116 model before. Which line and implantation approach are you tied to?

[02:11] Dr. Chen: We used the HCT116 subcutaneous model, standard implantation. We can share the protocol and prior report.

[02:21] Maya: Great. We have that in-house, so matching your historical model will be straightforward. For the PD-L1 high lung model, which one are you leaning toward?

[02:34] Dr. Chen: We are leaning toward a PD-L1 high A549 variant. Your team mentioned you have used an A549 PD-L1 high model with another client. Our concern is that we have seen variability in implantation with a prior CRO.

[02:49] Maya: Thanks, that is important. We can talk through how we manage that. For A549 PD-L1 high, we typically over-enroll at implant and use strict tumor take criteria, with pre-randomization culling if tumors do not reach threshold volume. We also run historical QC on take rate and growth curves. If we proceed, we can include an implantation quality control figure in the report and build in contingency for extra animals. Would that address your consistency risk?

[03:12] Dr. Chen: Yes, assuming you can show data.

[03:15] Maya: We will include that. Study design-wise, you said two models, three arms per model, 8 to 10 animals per arm. Vehicle, low, high. Any thoughts yet on dose levels?

[03:28] Dr. Chen: We are still finalizing. We have a workable exposure target from our PK, and we know we want to bracket around the in vitro IC50 exposure, but we will confirm after stability is finalized.

[03:46] Maya: Great. We will draft the plan with placeholders for low and high dose levels, tied to your exposure targets. For biomarkers, you mentioned pERK and Ki-67, with IHC and image analysis on your behalf. Anything else?

[04:06] Dr. Chen: We would like tissue banking for future RNA-seq if it is easy to add. Not mandatory.

[04:13] Maya: Easy add-on. We will price it as an option line item. Do you want interim updates?

[04:20] Dr. Chen: Weekly interim curves would be ideal.

[04:24] Maya: Done. We will build in weekly interim tumor volume updates for both models. Now, on the DRF – you mentioned it is optional but would be helpful to de-risk GLP. Can you share where you are on that decision?

[04:38] Dr. Chen: We are leaning toward doing a short non-GLP DRF in rat. Probably once daily oral dosing for 7 days. We mainly need tolerability and exposure to confirm that the GLP design is reasonable. But we are budget-sensitive.

[04:56] Maya: Understood. A non-GLP 7-day rat DRF is very standard for us. What we typically do is run it with a limited number of animals per sex per group, just enough to get a read on MTD, gross tolerability, and exposure. Then you can decide whether to expand in GLP. If we run DRF in parallel with the efficacy, you would have readouts in a similar window. Does that parallel run add value for you?

[05:19] Dr. Chen: Yes, as long as it does not push out the efficacy start. The main thing is that we do not want tox to become the bottleneck.

[05:28] Maya: Makes sense. What I suggest is that we treat the DRF as a modular add-on in the proposal. We will show scenario A, efficacy plus biomarkers only, and scenario B, efficacy plus biomarkers plus parallel DRF. That way you and Jenna can see the incremental cost and decide. For GLP, if DRF looks clean, we can slot you into a Q1 window without having to re-work the design.

[05:51] Dr. Chen: That would be helpful.

[05:54] Maya: Great. Let me summarize what you are solving for, just to be sure we have it right. You need: one, clean efficacy data in two relevant models, with pERK and Ki-67 biomarkers, to make an end-of-January go/no-go on the IND. Two, a clear path to GLP tox that does not bottleneck your IND. And three, confidence in timeline and implantation consistency so you do not run into the issues you saw with the prior CRO.

[06:20] Dr. Chen: Yes, exactly.

[06:23] Maya: Perfect. Let us talk next steps. You asked for a proposal by Thursday. If we send it by Thursday afternoon, can Jenna review Friday morning?

[06:34] Dr. Chen: Yes, she reviews everything Friday mornings.

[06:37] Maya: Great. And would you be open to a 30-minute technical scoping call next week with our discovery biology lead and our DSA tox lead? That way we can lock down dose levels, biomarkers, and DRF design upfront.

[06:50] Dr. Chen: Yes, Tuesday morning works.

[06:53] Maya: Perfect. Before we close, anything else you want to make sure we capture?

[06:59] Dr. Chen: No, this covers everything. Just make sure the timeline is firm.

[07:03] Maya: Understood. We will anchor a firm first-dose date and readout schedule in the proposal.

[07:10] Dr. Chen: Great.

[07:13] Maya: Thanks again, Dr. Chen. We will send the proposal Thursday and hold Tuesday morning for the technical call.

[07:20] Dr. Chen: Sounds good. Talk soon.
