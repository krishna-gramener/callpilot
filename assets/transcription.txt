 Hey Dr. Chen, really appreciate you making time for this discovery call. I know you've got Wuchi and LabCorp in the mix, so my plan is to get super clear on scope, timing, and where CRL can be most helpful for NC217. Does that line up with what you're hoping for today? Definitely. We're moving fast on this program, so what matters most to me is understanding whether you can help us hit our window. Timelines are tight. Totally get it. Just to make sure I've got everything right, NC217 is a small molecule oncology candidate in late lead optimization. You're looking for two xenograft efficacy models, colorectal and a PDL, one high lung model with PERC and KEY 67 biomarkers. First readouts in six to eight weeks, aiming for an end of January, Go divided by no go triggered to hit IND in early Q2. Plus, you might tack on a non-GLP RAT DRF in parallel, if possible. And the efficacy budget is in the 250k to 300k range. Did I miss anything? That sums it up. The big thing is making sure those early readouts are feasible so we don't lose momentum. It's interesting how crucial those first readouts are. You mentioned the six- to eight-week window. Just to clarify, is that clock ticking from when we receive the compound or from actual study start? From the moment you get the compound, we need tumor curves in hand early enough to make the end-of-January decision. If we slip, everything else gets pushed, including IND. Got it. The pressure is real. With batch release set for Friday and shipping next week, we'd likely start prepping right away. Animals could go on study about two weeks after receipt keeping us inside that six week window for data Does a mid study start fit to your overall plan It does, but we'll need an exact start date. Our COO, Jenna, won't sign off without that on paper. Makes sense. We'll put together a Gantt timeline in the proposal so it's all clear and actionable. That actually reminds me, on the efficacy models, You mentioned having used a specific colorectal xenograft before. Which line and implantation method do you prefer? We've always used the HCT116 line with standard subcutaneous implantation. I can share the protocol and our last report to make sure we're all aligned. Perfect. We have HCT116 in-house, so matching your historical protocol shouldn't be a problem. For the PD-L1 high lung model, which variant are you thinking? We're leaning toward a PD-L1 high, a 549 variant. The challenge is we haven't run it much internally, and a previous CRO struggled with consistent implantation. That could be tricky. We put a big focus on implantation QC tracking, take rate and tumor size distribution before we randomize. If take rate is a concern, we can add extra animals as a backup. Would it help if we show you our historical data? Yeah, as long as you can show actual data on consistency, that would put us at ease. Last time, the variability cost us weeks. Absolutely, we'll include the data. Looking at study design, you said three arms per model vehicle, low and high doses, about 8 to 10 animals per arm. Are you settled on dose levels yet? We're still working through that. We've got an oral formulation at 10 milligrams per milliliter, and we'll likely bracket doses around the in vitro IC50 exposure. But we'll confirm once we lock down stability. No problem We use placeholders in the draft plan and update doses once you share your PK and stability data For endpoints Tumour Growth Inhibition is the main readout plus PERC and KEY 67 with IHC and Image Analysis Anything else on your wish list? If it's easy to add, tissue banking for future RNA-seq would be great, but it's not a deal-breaker. That straightforward will price it as an option. And just to keep you in the loop, would weekly interim updates on tumour curves be helpful? Weekly curves would be ideal. It keeps everyone in sync. On safety, the non-GLP-RAT DRF is mostly for board reassurance and early risk reduction. We'd want a 7-day tolerability readout with some exposure data. Nothing fancy. Makes sense, especially if you might pull the plug if efficacy isn't strong. We can run a seven-day non-GLP DRF in rats in parallel, assuming schedules line up, and we'll make sure endpoints let you roll into GLP talks later if things look good. Still thinking March for a GLP talks kick-off if January data is positive? That's right. If the efficacy is there in January, we'll make the call on GLP talks in March. That timing gives us some breathing room. Good. It helps to have a clear roadmap. On the decision side, you said it's you and COO Jenna making the call, with procurement after. Will Jenna want a joint review meeting? Exactly. She'll want to review pricing and the timeline with me. And she'll definitely ask why CRL over Wuxi, especially if we pick just one partner. We'll make that comparison straightforward. Speaking of which, are there specific concerns with WUSHI or Labcorp, or is it mostly about cost and speed? WUSHI's fast and competitive financially, but we had headaches with inconsistent tumor implantation quality last time. Labcorp is solid for TOCS but less experienced with these efficacy models That helpful We highlight our QC processes and the upside of having one partner handle both efficacy and safety so you don't have to juggle two CROs. Staying on pricing, you mentioned 250k to 300k as a target for efficacy. If we're a bit over, is there wiggle room? There's not much flexibility. If you're materially higher, we'd need a strong rationale, or we might split vendors. Understood. We'll aim to stay in range, and I'll lay out two scenarios in the proposal. Efficacy only, and efficacy plus DERF, so you can choose what fits best. That would be really helpful. On our end, I'll send you our historical colorectal protocol and last report, plus a PK summary by tomorrow. Stability data might take until early next week. Perfect. Here's the plan. You send protocol, report and PK summary tomorrow, then stability notes as soon as you have them. We'll get you a proposal with timeline and pricing by Thursday covering both scenarios. If things look good, let's schedule a 30-minute tech call with our biology and tox leads next week to hammer down models and endpoints. Does that fit your internal schedule? Yep, if I have your proposal by Thursday, I can review with Jenna Friday morning. After that, we should be ready to decide next week. Great. I'll tentatively hold Tuesday at 11 a.m. ET for that technical call, pending your review. Is there anything else you want us to address up front? Just be sure to cover the lung model consistency and give us a firm timeline. Those are Jenna's big asks. Absolutely, those will be front and centre in the proposal. I'll drop you a quick recap email today and the full proposal Thursday. Thanks so much for the candid discussion, Dr Chen. Thank you, Maya. Looking forward to moving this forward.
