Hi Dr. Chen,

I am Maya Patel from Charles River. I lead oncology discovery services. We work with several biotech teams in late lead optimization to run rapid xenograft efficacy packages and, when needed, parallel non-GLP tolerability to de-risk IND plans.

I saw NovaCura recently hired a translational lead for oncology and assumed NC-217 may be approaching in vivo confirmation. If you are planning a January decision gate, we can usually deliver first tumor growth readouts in a 6 to 8 week window from compound receipt, with biomarker add-ons like pERK and Ki-67.

If helpful, I can share a 1-page outline of a typical scope and timeline.

Best,
Maya Patel
Director, Oncology Discovery Services

Hi Maya,

We are evaluating partners for NC-217 in vivo work.
Send the outline.

Hi Dr. Chen,

Thanks. Here is a concise outline so you can see if this aligns (happy to refine on a call):

Proposed efficacy package (non-GLP):

* 2 xenograft models (often colorectal plus a lung or other solid tumor model).
* 3 arms per model (vehicle, low, high), typically 8 to 10 animals per arm.
* Endpoints: tumor growth inhibition, survival as needed.
* Biomarkers: pERK and Ki-67 IHC with digital image analysis (optional tissue banking for future RNA-seq).
* Interim weekly data drops, final integrated report.

Typical timing (from compound receipt):

* Model prep: ~2 weeks
* On-study and first readouts: 4 to 6 weeks
* Total to first data: 6 to 8 weeks

Optional early safety (if board wants de-risking before GLP tox):

* 7-day non-GLP rat dose range finding (DSA group), can run in parallel to efficacy.

To tailor this, I need a few quick data points:

1. Which two models are you leaning toward?
2. Any fixed endpoints beyond tumor volumes (e.g., pERK, Ki-67 confirmed)?
3. When could you ship compound?
4. Are you thinking DRF now or only after efficacy?

If it is easier, we can cover in a 30 min discovery call next week.

Best,
Maya

Hi Maya,

High level:

* Two models: a colorectal xenograft we have used before, plus a PD-L1 high lung cancer model (newer for us).
* Endpoints: tumor growth inhibition, pERK and Ki-67. If you can run IHC and analysis, that helps.
* Timeline: first readouts in ~6 to 8 weeks. We have a go/no-go end of January tied to IND plans for early Q2 next year.
* Compound: batch release this Friday, can ship early next week.
* Early safety: board is asking for a short non-GLP rat tolerability / DRF in parallel if feasible, but efficacy is priority.
* Budget expectation for efficacy (incl biomarkers): USD 250K to 300K. We are also speaking to WuXi and Labcorp for comparison.

We should talk.

Hi Dr. Chen,

This is exactly the kind of program we can support, and your timeline is workable if we receive compound next week. We will come prepared to address:

* implantation consistency for the PD-L1 high lung model
* keeping first readouts inside your January gate
* pricing in your expected range, with an optional parallel DRF scenario

Let’s do a 30 to 40 min discovery call to finalize scope and timeline. I can also bring a discovery biology lead to confirm model selection and QC details.

Does Thu Nov 13 at 11:00 AM ET work? If not, send a couple of slots and I will adjust.

Best,
Maya Patel
